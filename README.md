# bracketclub packages

A monorepo that holds all the [bracket.club](https://bracket.club) packages used across the website, entry watcher, score watcher, and API.

## TODO:

- [ ] Update all tests to use latest version of node-tap (and drop mocha)
- [ ] Next major: functions > classes
- [ ] Use babel preset env + rollup for all browser modules
- [ ] Remove browser builds of bracket-data since they were unused. Experiment with bring-your-own data instead.
